## Overview
- The Bernoulli distribution models the outcomes of a single binary experiment with two possible outcomes: success (1) and failure (0).

## Use Case
- Used when there are only two possible outcomes in a random experiment, such as flipping a coin, single trial success or failure, or whether a single event occurs or not.

## Formula
- Probability Mass Function (PMF):
  $$
  P(X = x) = \begin{cases} 
  p & \text{if } x = 1 \\
  1 - p & \text{if } x = 0
  \end{cases}
  $$
  - \( p \): Probability of success (getting 1)
  
## Example
- **Coin Flipping**: 
  - Let $p = 0.5$ (fair coin).
  - PMF:
    - $P(X = 1) = 0.5$ (probability of getting heads)
    - $P(X = 0) = 0.5$ (probability of getting tails)
