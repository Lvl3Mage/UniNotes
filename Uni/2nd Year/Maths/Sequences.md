$\text{A sequence is defined as an function a : }\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \text{X where X is a set (usually X=}\mathbb{R\text{)}}$
$\text{Usually a(n) is written as } a_n\text{. This expression is typically called the general term of the sequence}$

## Bounding
The sequence $a_n$ can be:
- Upper bounded if $\exists M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a_n \leq M$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
- Lower bounded if $\exists M \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $a_n \geq M$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
If a sequence meets both of these conditions, it is simply called **bounded**.

In some cases, the bounds can also serve as sequence maximums and minimums:
- A **lower bound** can be referred to as a **minimum** if it is the largest lower bound and is a part of the sequence $a_n$.
- Similarly, an **upper bound** can be called a **maximum** if it is the smallest upper bound and belongs to the sequence $a_n.

For example, let's consider the sequence defined by $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$.
- This sequence is **upper bounded by 1**, and 1 serves as the sequence's maximum.
- It is also **lower bounded by 0**, although the lower bound is not the sequence minimum since it is not part of the sequence.
