# $$ V = I * R $$

# Explanation
The easiest way to understand Ohm's Law and electric flow in general is to compare flowing electricity to water flowing through a pipe

## Intensity
You can then compare __intensity__ as the volume of water that flows through. 


`.img--50, center`![[Intensity.excalidraw|100%]]

In case of intensity (which is measured in amperes): $$1\space Ampere = 6.28*10^{18}\space electrons/s$$
## Voltage
Voltage can be seen as the pressure in the pipe

## Resistance
Resistance can be related to the throughput of the pipe (its width/radius).
