Displacement mapping shifts actual vertices of a model based on a texture (Displacement Map), making it appear truly deformed or bumpy.

>[!info]
> Unlike normal mapping, displacement mapping actually alters the geometry of the object, which means it changes both its silhouette and depth.

>[!summary] **Intuition for Displacement Mapping**  
> Think of it as carving or sculpting an object based on a template (the displacement map). Each vertex on the surface shifts, so the model reflects the textureâ€™s shape in a real, physical way.
