3D textures are arrays of 2D textures stacked to represent not only the surface but also the internal structure of an object.

> 3D textures use three coordinates $(s, t, r)$ to access the data, allowing the entire volume of the object to be textured rather than just the surface.

> Imagine slicing through a loaf of bread. Each slice is like a 2D texture in a 3D texture stack, allowing you to visualize the interior. This technique is often used in medical imaging or volume rendering.
