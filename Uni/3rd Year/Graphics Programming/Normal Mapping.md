Normal mapping uses a texture (Normal Map) to alter the surface normals of an object, creating the illusion of complex surface detail like bumps and scratches without adding extra geometry.

>[!info]
> Normal maps encode variations in surface direction, making light reflect as if the surface has depth and detail. Unlike actual geometry, it doesn't change the silhouette of the object.

>[!summary] **You can think of normal mapping as...**  
> adding “fake” bumps to the surface. Imagine a textured wallpaper—it looks like it has depth, but if you touch it, it’s actually flat. Normal maps create this illusion using light interaction.
